# Nextstrain builds for particular variants of interest

## Repo organization

### Nextstrain build

Most of the repository is a fork of [github.com/nextstrain/ncov](https://github.com/nextstrain/ncov) that's been tailored to conduct Nextstrain builds focusing on particular variants. To reproduce this build manually download GISAID data as `data/sequences.fasta` and `data/metadata.tsv`.

The current endpoints for this build are:
- `ncov_variants_20b-501y-v1.json`
These can be generated by running `snakemake -p --profile my_profiles/variants`.

This relies on collecting variant strains from global alignment by first running:
```
python scripts/identify-matching-haplotypes.py --alignment ../ncov/results/aligned.fasta
```
and updating `default/include.txt` appropriately.
